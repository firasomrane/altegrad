Question 1: 
It is obvious that the density increases by increasing the window size since we will capture more couples of words and so more edges.
But the fact that the density never reaches 1 even when we use a window that includes all the terms in the document is not true.
Since there are texts where we can capture all the combinations of the words. For example if we want to have a density of 1 with
window size of 4 we can just use 4 words that will exist after cleaning the text and then add to it the first 3 words
Example 'graph text mining density graph text mining' we will get a dinsity of 1 with window = 4 since all combinations are captured.



Question 2: 
The time complexity of k core decomposition:
n = |V|
m = |E|
line2: while O(n) // loop over all the vertices
    line 3: O(n) // get the vertex with the lowest weight
    
    line 6 and 7: O(m + n) // O(m) to delete the node and edges and calculate the new degrees

O(n^2 + n*m)
